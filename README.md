# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data

This is the submission for Week 4 Getting and Cleaning Data project regarding activity data obtained by wearables.

The CodeBook.md explains the process involved in writing the script.

The FinalData.txt is the tidy data that I compiled.

The run_analysis.R is the actual code I used to complete this assignment.
